# react-cssmodules-noeject-demo
This project illustrates using CSS Modules in React applications created by the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool (CRA) and without ejecting.

The code is based on two articles:
* ["How to Use CSS Modules with Create React App"](https://medium.com/nulogy/how-to-use-css-modules-with-create-react-app-9e44bec2b5c2);
* [Maintaining a fork of create-react-app as an alternative to ejecting](https://medium.com/@denis.zhbankov/maintaining-a-fork-of-create-react-app-as-an-alternative-to-ejecting-c555e8eb2b63).
